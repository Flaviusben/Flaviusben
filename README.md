### **Projecting Romania's Electricity Prices: An Analysis of NECP Scenarios & Renewable Energy Impact** - as part of my Bachelor's Thesis
🔗 **[View Electricity Prices Project](projects/REI-Impact-and-Electricity-Prices.html)**

#### 🔍 **Key Insights:**
  ✅**Historical Price Drivers Identified:** Developed a robust log-linear OLS model (2015-2022 data) with Newey-West HAC standard errors, confirming EU ETS carbon costs and fossil fuel production levels significantly increased historical electricity prices, while wind and hydro generation had a statistically significant price-depressing effect (merit-order).
  ✅**Scenario Projections (WAM vs. WEM):** Utilized the validated historical model to project average monthly electricity prices for Romania under the NECP’s 'With Existing Measures' (WEM) and 'With Additional Measures' (WAM) scenarios for 2025 and 2030.
  ✅**WAM Shows Significant Price Advantage:** Projections indicate the WAM scenario consistently yields lower average electricity prices compared to WEM, with the difference widening to approximately €20.1/MWh by 2030.
  ✅**Wind Power as Key Differentiator:** WAM’s projected price advantage is predominantly attributable to its significantly higher assumed deployment of wind power.

#### 📈 **Real-World Impact & Policy Relevance:**
  📌**Quantified Economic Benefit of Ambitious RE Policy:** Provides novel quantitative evidence suggesting that pursuing the more ambitious WAM pathway, with its higher renewable energy targets, offers a potential for considerable savings on average wholesale electricity prices for Romania by 2030.
  📌**Highlights Critical Role of Wind Deployment:** Pinpoints large-scale wind power integration as the primary quantifiable driver of WAM’s projected lower price trajectory, emphasizing the importance of policies that effectively stimulate wind investments.
  📌**Underscores Policy Stability Imperative:** While quantitatively demonstrating WAM’s potential, the research (informed by qualitative literature like Marinescu, 2020) stresses that realizing these economic benefits is fundamentally contingent upon creating stable, predictable, and confidence-inspiring policy frameworks to attract the necessary large-scale RE investments.

### **Machine Learning: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**

*Explored customer sentiment and feedback trends using sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques in R. The main goal was to uncover key themes in customer reviews and analyze their impact on products satisfaction and sales.*

#### 🔍 **Key Insights:**  
✅ **Sentiment Analysis:** Used `tidytext` with **NRC** and **Bing** lexicons to classify reviews as positive/negative.  
✅ **Bigram & Trigram Analysis:** Extracted common word pairings to reveal sentiment-driving phrases.  
✅ **Topic Modeling (LDA):** Identified hidden themes in customer feedback (e.g., **technical issues, delivery concerns, product satisfaction**).  
✅ **Predictive Modeling:** Developed a customer satisfaction model by integrating **review sentiment, ratings, and product feedback**. (in propgress) 
The chart below shows the correlation between customer sentiment and income in the main product topics discovered through topic modeling.

#### 📈 **Business Impact:**  
📌 Uncovered key **pain points** such as **technical and delivery issues**, leading to actionable product improvements.  
📌 Mapped sentiment insights to **high-impact product categories** for better targeting.  
📌 Connected **exploratory analysis** with **predictive modeling**, enhancing customer retention strategies.  

### **Analyzing the average sea level change since 1880 and predicting sea level until 2050.**
🔗 **[View Sea-Level-Rise Project](projects/Sea-Level-Rise.html)**
#### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Historical Trend**:
  - 🌊 Sea levels have risen consistently since measurements began, with an average rise of 6.29 inches per century based on historical data.
- **Recent Acceleration**:
  - 📈 Recent trends show a faster rise of 16.11 inches per century—2.56 times the historical average.
- **Projections for 2050**:
  - 📅 Based on historical data: ~10.15 inches by 2050.
  - 📅 Based on recent trends: ~15.11 inches by 2050.
  - ✨ Difference: 4.96 inches, highlighting the need to account for accelerating trends.
